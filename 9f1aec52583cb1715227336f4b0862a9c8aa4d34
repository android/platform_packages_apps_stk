      "message": "Thanks for your comments, but please refer to the comment before sleep().\n\n\u003e // a small delay, let the browser start, before processing the next command.\n\u003e // this is good for scenarios where a related DISPLAY TEXT command is\n\u003e // followed immediately.\n\nIn our understanding, this sleep() was added just to wait for a browser application to be launched before processing next command. That means next command should not be processed regardless of dependency on browser.ã€€Actually, there is no commands which specifically depend on browser - e.g. command which uses browser function.",
