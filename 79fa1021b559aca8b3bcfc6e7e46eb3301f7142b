      "message": "GSMA TS.38 (PDATA.12) expects that \"Home\" and \"Multi task\" are differentiated. There is a risk to make service providers concern it especially in 3-button navigation mode. It is just a risk right now and we will explain this is the standard behavior of the recent version of Android SIM Toolkit, though.\n\nhttps://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads//TS.38-v2.0.pdf",

      "message": "In 3 and 2 button navigation mode, if the user intends to cancel the operation they are able to use the \"back\" button. I understand that this behavior for \"recentapps\" is not technically what is defined in the spec, but as part of gesture navigation support I think it better captures user intent in the ambiguous cases (some carrier testers have already had trouble triggering terminal responses via \"home\" presses because their gestures were interpreted as \"recentapps\" instead.)",
